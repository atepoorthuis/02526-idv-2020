# Assignment 2

For your second assignment, you should recreate your graph from the first assignment using JavaScript instead of only HTML/CSS. A few things to consider:

- Experiment with the foundational concepts you have learned so far. At the very least you should consider:
  1. Store your chart data in an array or object.
  2. Use a loop to programmatically build each item in your chart.
  3. Use one or more functions to help structure and maintain legibility of your code.
- Deviate from Du Bois' original work in one important way: think of a way to add a simple user interaction to your graph. This could be purely visual (e.g. color change; slight change in size of an element; a small positional jump) or more informative (e.g. a tooltip that displays information about a chart element).
- If your original graph does not work so well for this assignment, feel free to pick a different one.


You can use the boilerplate CodeSandbox below as a starting point or use the CodeSandbox from your previous assignment. Regardless, you will have to add both Assignment 1 and the current assignment to the appropriate directory in your Github repository. Once you are finished with your work, create a new issue, title it 'Assignment 2 by [your_name]'. In the body of the issue, include at least a link to the last commit you made as part of your assignment, ‘at’ the teaching team (include @teaching in your text), and include a screenshot of your chart. To link to a specific commit, you can just include the SHA (a short code uniquely identifying a commit) in your issue. You can find the SHA codes in the history of your commits (e.g. at https://github.com/02526-idv/02526-idv-2020/commits/master my first commit has SHA '309a93b').
