# Final Project Video Gallery
You will find a gallery of all final project videos here. Each submission is displayed using the explanation video from the group that introduces the project, its main purpose and the actual visualization Students also speak out 1-2 of the aspects they have found particularly interesting (design decisions, technical hurdles, etc.) and talk through how they approached these issues and what solution the came up with.

**N.B.** <writeup>

```js exec
  // use small Svelte component to make creating linked image gallery a bit easier
  import ImageWithLinkAndCaption from '../../components/ImageWithLinkAndCaption.svelte'
```
