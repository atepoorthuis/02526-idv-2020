# Assignment 1

For your first assignment, you will have to select [one of Du Bois's other graphs](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=drawing&co=anedub&st=gallery) and recreate it in the same way as we did together with Plate 39. A few considerations:

- Stay away from maps for now. We'll cover those in a few weeks.
- In order of difficulty of the remaining charts:
  1. Bar charts are likely to be the simplest to execute (using the `rect` element).
  2. Line charts (use the `path` element, [see MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths))
  3. Bar charts with curves can be done using the `path` element and curves/arcs.
  4. Pie charts are similar in this regard, but require [a bit more math](https://danielpataki.com/svg-pie-chart-javascript/)


Even if you already are familiar with Javascript, constrain yourself to using only HTML/SVG and CSS for this assignment. Don't worry – we will unleash the power of Javascript soon enough.

You can use the boilerplate CodeSandbox below as a starting point. Fork it and save to your own CodeSandBox account. Once you are finished, navigate to your own Github repository at `https://github.com/02526-idv/[your-name]`. Create a new issue, title it 'Assignment 1 by [your_name]', and include both a screenshot of the final result as well as a link to the CodeSandbox.
